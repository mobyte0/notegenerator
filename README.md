# notegenerator
generates files for taking notes

a basic script that creates and manages directories that you want to save notes in. code isn't great so far, just made this quickly for something to do. if you find something wrong with the code or want to help out in improving it, feel free to send a push request.

planned features:
  -ability to change thing in config file without deleting it entirely
  -editing of template from inside the program without having to mess with hardcode
